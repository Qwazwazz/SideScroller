# Task 3: Complete Patterns Integration

# Project Evolution
# Task 2 Foundation
- Singleton Pattern: GameManager, AudioManager
- Basic game with centralized management

## Task 3 Additions
## Observer Pattern
- EventManager for decoupled communication
- Events implemented: OnEnemyDefeated, OnPlayerStateChanged, OnCoinCollected, OnLevelComplete
- Observers: UIManager, Achievements

## State Machine Pattern
- Player States: Idle, Jumping, Moving
- Game States: Enhanced from Task 2
- State transitions: When moving in any direction, shooting, 

### Key Integration Points
1. Score System: Singleton → Observer → UI
2. Player Actions: Input → State → Event → Audio
3. Game Flow: GameState → Events → Scene Changes
